Deep Learning for Early Warning of Acute Hypotensive Episodes

Pulse Guard: Deep Learning for Early Warning of Acute Hypotensive Episodes. (CNN, Python, SQL, Azure Data Factory).

• Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze patient vitals and detect early signs of hypotensive episodes.

• Utilized Azure Data Factory for seamless data integration and processing from various sources and Implemented data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques using Python and SQL.

• Enhanced patient care by reducing response times and improving the accuracy of early warnings.
